# Data-Viz-With-IIP

Anyone who is interested in Data Visualizations related to India must have seen some really cool graphics from India in Pixels (https://twitter.com/indiainpixels).

Ashris is the guy behind the amazing work at IIP. Together with Unacademy, he has started a course on Data Visualization. Every Weekend a certain aspect of Data Viz will be taught and a certain challenge will be given to for everyone to participate.

Week-1 Challenge:

## Dear Alien Friend

You have made an alien friend from Mars.
They are curious about your life. The catch is - they donâ€™t understand human text but do understand numbers, shapes, geometry, colors, symbols, and signs.
Create a data portrait that helps your alien friend understand some aspect of your life -
(ex. friendship / music taste / personality / habits / relationships / ambition)
Constrain: You have to include at least one data point that is qualitative, one that is quantitative.

## Best State of India

What is your definition of a good state?
Define six characteristics of a good state. Find datasets that help you compare all the states of India on the basis of these six traits. Decide which state is the best state.
Note: You need not base your definition on any existing framework.

I decided to do the Best State of India Challenge.
For that, I used the following 6 traits:

**Literacy Rate**: http://www.pincodeindia.net/literacy-rate.php
