Anyone who is interested in Data Visualizations related to India must have seen some really cool graphics from [India in Pixels](https://twitter.com/indiainpixels).

Ashris is the guy behind the amazing work at IIP. Together with Unacademy, he has started a course on Data Visualization. Every Weekend a certain aspect of Data Viz will be taught and a certain challenge will be given for everyone to participate.

## Week-1 Challenge

**Dear Alien Friend**

You have made an alien friend from Mars.
They are curious about your life. The catch is - they donâ€™t understand human text but do understand numbers, shapes, geometry, colors, symbols, and signs.
Create a data portrait that helps your alien friend understand some aspect of your life -
(ex. friendship / music taste / personality / habits / relationships / ambition)
Constrain: You have to include at least one data point that is qualitative, one that is quantitative.

or

**Best State of India**

What is your definition of a good state?
Define six characteristics of a good state. Find datasets that help you compare all the states of India on the basis of these six traits. Decide which state is the best state.
Note: You need not base your definition on any existing framework.

I decided to do the Best State of India Challenge.
For that, I used the following 6 traits:

### The Six Traits
---
1. **[Life Expectancy](https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=20671)**

> Data relating to Bihar, Madhya Pradhesh and Uttar Pradesh includes Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarkhand, respectively. For states with NA values, mean of all states is taken.
   
2. **[Literacy Rate](http://www.pincodeindia.net/literacy-rate.php)**

> Also called the "effective literacy rate"; the total percentage of the population of an area at a particular time aged seven years or above who can read and write with understanding. Here the denominator is the population aged seven years or more.

3. **[Unemployment Rate](https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=20673)**

> Employment figures are the sum of principal status and subsidiary status.

4. **[NSDP Per Capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_GDP_per_capita#cite_note-:0-2)**

> Net state domestic product (NSDP) is the state counterpart to a country's Net domestic product (NDP), which equals the gross domestic product (GDP) minus depreciation on a country's capital goods. For UTs with 0 value, a min value of 10000 has been given.

5. **[Violent Crimes (Incidence & Crime Rate)](https://ncrb.gov.in/en/crime-in-india-table-addtional-table-and-chapter-contents?field_date_value%5Bvalue%5D%5Byear%5D=2018&field_select_table_title_of_crim_value=All&items_per_page=All)**

> Crime Rate is calculated as Crime per one lakh of population.

6. **[Net State Value Added by Agriculture](https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=20684)**

 > Constant Prices
